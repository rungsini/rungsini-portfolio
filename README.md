# [Project 1: Models for the number of cases with Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever](hyperlink)

This is a project I did for my bachelor research paper, where I build a predictive model for the number of cases with DHF.

- Data was taken from the ......
- The model uses both; content-based filtering techniques and collaborative filtering techniques.
- Algorithms Used: K-Nearest Neightbours, TF-IDFS, Singular Value Decomposition Model (SVD), Alternatining least Squre (ALS)
- Optimised the SVD & ALS model.
- The Project Write-up is published on SSRN
